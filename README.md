# Kubernetes Nginx PHP-FPM App

In this tutorial, we will deploy a PHP application on a Kubernetes cluster with Nginx and PHP-FPM running in separate containers.

We want the web-server nginx and phpfpm to be co-located in separate pods.

### PHP-FPM
PHP-FPM is an implementation of Fast-CGI for PHP with improved capabilities around process management, logging, and high traffic situations.

### Nginx
Nginx is a web server and reverse proxy thatâ€™s widely used for high traffic applications. When run in combination with PHP-FPM, Nginx is configured to send requests for .php routes to PHP-FPM to serve the page.

We should upload the application files first, to all worker nodes to the directory /var/website as /var/website is volume path to containers.
